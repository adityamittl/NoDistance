## 💻 What it does

## ⚙️ How it works

## 🔨 How we built it
We used Figma to design the web app, and brought our design into reality through HTML , CSS and for backend we use Django. We got an exposure to wonderful sponsor technologies and used them in our project -- namely Auth0 , CockroachDB  (more details given below). 

## ⭕ Use of CockroachDB
- We used CockroachDB as database because it is an easy to use, open-source, and indestructible SQL database. It works well with Containers like Kubernetes and compatible with Postgresql.

##  Use of Auth0
- We used Auth0 authentication system for LogIn of users because we wanted to make an application very very secure. Auth0 provides the most extensive functionality to ensure the user authentication and authorization, with detailed analytics, a variety of available providers, and a diverse set of user-friendly tools the developer will really like. During the app development, we used social services to log-in like using Google which supported by Auth0.


## 🧠 Challenges we ran into

## 🏅 Accomplishments that we're proud of
- Completing a project that makes a difference in the lives of pepople. 
- Learning a lot: from workshops, sponsor technologies, competitors, MLHERS, and from each other. 
- Defeating the barriers , and working extra hard to complete this project. 

## 📖 What we learned
